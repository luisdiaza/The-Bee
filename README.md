Used to familiarize myself with product page design.  

Things I learned:
CSS specificity
Stylus CSS preprocessor
max-width property
to make sure that everything is the same height
Find the height of the biggest thing you want to line up with. Set that line-height to 1, and then use that elements font-size as the line-height for the things you want to line it up with
