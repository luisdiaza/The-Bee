Used to familiarize myself with product page design, stylus (preprocessor).  

Things I learned:

CSS specificity

Stylus CSS preprocessor

max-width property:

to make sure that everything is the same height find the height of the biggest thing you want to line up with. Set that line-height to 1,

and then use that elements font-size as the line-height for the things you want to line it up with
